<p>An alternative to ctrl+f, this adds functionality to your website with an additional callback after each button click.
This repo uses the highlight plugin of <a href="http://johannburkard.de/blog/programming/javascript/highlight-javascript-text-higlighting-jquery-plugin.html">Johnn Burkhard.</a> When search is made it will use jQuery animate() to scroll the element with the desired class. Next and prev buttons will scroll the element up and down to the other matches.</p>
